# Note About ESLint Error

There is a persistent ESLint error referencing `NewDashboard.jsx`:

```
ERROR
[eslint] src/components/dashboard/NewDashboard.jsx Line 167:126: Parsing error: Unexpected token, expected "," (167:126)
```

## Current Status

- The primary dashboard implementation is in `Dashboard.jsx` and appears to be functioning correctly.
- The error refers to `NewDashboard.jsx` which was a temporary file during development.
- We've tried multiple approaches to fix this error:
  1. Moving the file to an archive directory
  2. Creating a clean replacement file
  3. Clearing the ESLint cache
  4. Creating an empty file

## Recommendation

Since `Dashboard.jsx` is working properly and is the actual component being used in the application, you have a few options:

1. **Continue with the current setup**, ignoring the ESLint error about `NewDashboard.jsx`
2. **Add ESLint ignore comment** to `NewDashboard.jsx` if needed
3. **Modify the build configuration** to exclude `NewDashboard.jsx` from ESLint checks

## Next Steps

For a clean repository without warnings, you might consider:

1. Rebuilding the project from scratch without the problematic file
2. Modifying ESLint configuration to ignore the specific error
3. Consulting with a build configuration expert if these errors persist

Meanwhile, you can continue using the Dashboard component as implemented, as this ESLint error doesn't affect the actual functionality of the application.
