# Structure Analysis
## Common Patterns
1. All packages use Google Fonts (Inter and Poppins)
2. Homepage and pricing page share identical assets (icons, illustrations)
3. Homepage and pricing page both use styles.css and script.js
4. Dashboard has its own standalone structure
5. All packages use the same logo.svg but in different locations

## Repository Structure
1. React application with TypeScript
2. Has dedicated components for dashboard and pricing
3. Uses public directory for static assets
4. Follows standard React component structure
