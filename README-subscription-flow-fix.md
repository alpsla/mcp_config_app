# Subscription Flow Fix

This fix addresses issues with the subscription flow steps, including:

1. Missing navigation buttons in steps
2. Inconsistent progress bar display
3. Content being removed alongside progress bars

## Changes Made

1. **Updated progress bar display in SubscriptionFlow.tsx**:
   - Modified the progress steps to show all 6 steps: Welcome, Profile, Interests, Parameters, Payment, Success
   - Fixed step highlighting logic to properly track the current step

2. **Enhanced subscription-flow-fix.js scripts**:
   - Updated button visibility logic to specifically target `.navigation-buttons` containers
   - Added specific styling for navigation buttons to ensure proper display
   - Modified event handlers to be more aggressive in keeping navigation elements visible

3. **Improved CSS selectors in the fix scripts**:
   - Added selectors for `.button-cancel` and `.button-continue` classes
   - Ensured proper styling inheritance for button containers
   - Applied more specific styling to progress indicators

## How to Test

1. Navigate through the subscription flow:
   - Start at `/subscribe/welcome`
   - Proceed through Profile, Interests, Parameters, and Payment steps
   - Verify navigation buttons appear at each step
   - Confirm progress bar accurately reflects current position

2. For quick testing, run the following in the browser console:
   ```javascript
   window.testSubscriptionFlowFix()
   ```

## Technical Details

The fix uses several approaches:
- DOM manipulation to ensure navigation buttons remain visible
- CSS overrides to enforce proper styling
- MutationObserver to detect and fix dynamically added elements
- Multiple check intervals to guarantee consistent UI

These changes ensure a seamless subscription flow experience without disrupting the existing application architecture.
