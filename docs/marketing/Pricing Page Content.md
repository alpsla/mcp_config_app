## FAQ Section

```
What am I paying for exactly?
You're paying for the convenience and time savings of our configuration tool, not for the models themselves or for Claude. You'll need separate access to Claude and any models you want to connect.

Do I need technical knowledge to use this?
Not at all! Our tool is designed to make model configuration accessible to everyone, regardless of technical background.

Will this work with any model?
We currently support 10 carefully selected models that work well with Claude. We're adding more regularly based on user requests.

Can I try before I buy?
Absolutely! Start with our Free tier, which gives you access to 3 model configurations. No credit card required.

What happens after the beta?
Beta users will keep their current pricing for 12 months after our full release. After that, you'll have the option to move to our new pricing tiers or stay grandfathered at slightly adjusted rates.

Is there a discount for educational use?
Yes! We offer a 30-40% discount for verified students and educators. Contact our support team to apply.
