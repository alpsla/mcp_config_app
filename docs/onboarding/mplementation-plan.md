## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Fix Authentication Issues (Critical)**
   - Debug and fix email signup/login credentials mismatch
   - Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
   - Add user-friendly error messages for OAuth provider issues

2. **Create Main Dashboard (High Priority)**
   - Design and implement the main dashboard layout
   - Add configuration management (view, create, delete)
   - Implement "Coming Soon" section for Phase 2 features

3. **Fix Configuration Export Format (High Priority)**
   - Update export functionality to match Claude's required JSON structure:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "filesystem": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["...", "..."]
       },
       // other servers
     }
   }
   ```
   - Implement validation to ensure exports are compatible
   - Add visual feedback for successful export

4. **Complete File System Configuration (Medium Priority)**
   - Implement directory selection and management
   - Add directory path validation
   - Create permission explanation and security notices

5. **Enhance Subscription Tier Presentation (Medium Priority)**
   - Create visual indicators for tier-restricted features
   - Implement upgrade prompts for premium features
   - Add clear comparison of tier benefits

## Detailed Sub-Tasks for Immediate Priorities

### 1. Fix Authentication Issues

```
- Investigate Supabase email authentication configuration
- Verify password hashing and storage
- Test authentication flow with debugging enabled
- Add detailed error logging for authentication failures
- Create user-friendly error messages for common auth issues
- Test authentication across different browsers
```

### 2. Create Main Dashboard

```
- Design dashboard layout with recent configurations
- Implement configuration card components
- Create "Create New Configuration" button/flow
- Build configuration listing with search/filter
- Add "Coming Soon" section with planned features
- Implement responsive design for dashboard
```

### 3. Fix Configuration Export Format

```
- Update JSON structure to match Claude's requirements
- Create transformation function for export
- Add validation to ensure export compatibility
- Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Create visual confirmation for successful export
- Add download option for configuration file
```

### 4. Complete File System Configuration

```
- Implement directory browser/selector component
- Add validation for selected directories
- Create permission explanation dialogs
- Implement directory persistence in configuration
- Test on multiple platforms (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Add security notices and best practices
```

### 5. Enhance Subscription Tier Presentation

```
- Design tier comparison component
- Create visual indicators for tier-restricted features
- Implement upgrade flow from free to paid tiers
- Add tooltips explaining tier benefits
- Create subscription management section
- Implement payment processing integration
```

## Phase 2: Future Development (Unchanged)

The plan for Phase 2 remains as originally outlined, focusing on:

- Full Marketplace Experience
- Analytics & Advanced Configuration
- Community & Documentation
- Enterprise Features

These will be addressed after successfully completing the Phase 1 implementation priorities.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Focus on User Experience**: Prioritize clear error messages and intuitive interfaces
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Test all authentication flows and export functionality extensively
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure core features work on both desktop and mobile
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation as features are completed
5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling throughout the application

## Technical Considerations

- Use TypeScript consistently throughout the codebase
- Maintain separation of concerns between services and UI components
- Focus on accessibility compliance for all new components
- Prioritize performance optimization for configuration management
- Ensure secure handling of authentication tokens and user data

This implementation plan will be reviewed weekly to track progress and adjust priorities as needed.
