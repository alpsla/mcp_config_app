## Test Cases for Critical Functionality

### Toggle Functionality Test Cases

1. **Basic Toggle Operation**
   - **Given**: Configuration page is loaded
   - **When**: User clicks on a service toggle
   - **Then**: Toggle should change state (on/off)
   - **And**: Service should be enabled/disabled accordingly

2. **Service Selection After Toggle**
   - **Given**: Multiple services are toggled on
   - **When**: User clicks on one service's info area
   - **Then**: That service should become "selected"
   - **And**: Right panel should update to show that service's options

3. **Toggle State Preservation**
   - **Given**: User has toggled several services
   - **When**: User navigates away and back to the configuration page
   - **Then**: Toggle states should be preserved

### Configuration Export Test Cases

1. **JSON Format Validation**
   - **Given**: User has configured services
   - **When**: Export button is clicked
   - **Then**: Generated JSON should match Claude's required format exactly

2. **Copy to Clipboard**
   - **Given**: Export button is clicked
   - **When**: Copy action completes
   - **Then**: Clipboard should contain valid configuration JSON

3. **Configuration Validation**
   - **Given**: Configuration is exported
   - **When**: Validation is performed
   - **Then**: Validation results should reflect the configuration state

### Hugging Face Model Selection Test Cases

1. **Model Selection**
   - **Given**: Hugging Face section is enabled
   - **When**: User clicks on a model
   - **Then**: Model should be selected and highlighted

2. **Tier Limit Enforcement**
   - **Given**: User on Basic tier has selected 3 models
   - **When**: User attempts to select a 4th model
   - **Then**: System should prevent selection and show upgrade prompt

3. **Tier Upgrade Flow**
   - **Given**: User hits tier limit
   - **When**: User clicks upgrade
   - **Then**: Upgrade flow should initiate correctly

## Bug Tracking and Prioritization

All identified issues will be logged with the following information:
- Issue description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Screenshots/videos if applicable
- Severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Component affected

Issues will be prioritized as follows:
1. **Critical**: Blocking core functionality, must fix immediately
2. **High**: Significant impact on usability, should fix before release
3. **Medium**: Affects experience but has workarounds, fix if time permits
4. **Low**: Minor issues or cosmetic problems, can defer
