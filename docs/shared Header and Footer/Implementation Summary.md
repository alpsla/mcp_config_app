# Implementation Summary: Shared Header and Footer Components

## What We've Accomplished

We've successfully implemented a unified branding approach for both the MCP Config and PR Reviewer applications by:

1. **Creating shared components in both applications:**
   - `CodeQualLogo` component for the brand logo
   - `Header`/`SharedHeader` for the navigation header
   - `Footer`/`SharedFooter` for the footer
   - `FAQItem` and `FAQSection` for reusable FAQ sections

2. **Cleaned up duplicated code:**
   - Replaced duplicate FAQ logic with a reusable component
   - Unified styling for common elements
   - Applied consistent branding across both applications

3. **Added app-specific customization:**
   - Each app displays its name alongside the CodeQual brand
   - App-specific navigation links
   - App-specific footer links
   - Maintained each app's unique styling for their content sections

## Code Implemented

### PR Reviewer Project:
- `/apps/web/src/components/common/CodeQualLogo.tsx`
- `/apps/web/src/components/common/SharedHeader.tsx`
- `/apps/web/src/components/common/SharedFooter.tsx`
- Updated main page to use the shared components

### MCP Config Project:
- `/src/components/common/CodeQualLogo.jsx`
- `/src/components/common/Header.jsx`
- `/src/components/common/Footer.jsx`
- `/src/components/common/FAQItem.jsx`
- `/src/components/common/FAQSection.jsx`
- `/src/styles/components/Header.css`
- `/src/styles/components/Footer.css`
- `/src/styles/components/FAQ.css`
- Updated Homepage and Pricing components to use the shared components

## Next Steps

1. **Test Thoroughly:**
   - Test both applications to ensure the shared components work correctly
   - Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes
   - Check that theme toggles work as expected

2. **Create Consistent CSS Variables:**
   - Create a shared set of CSS variables for colors, spacing, and typography
   - This will ensure visual consistency across both applications

3. **Add More Components to Share:**
   - Identify other components that could be shared (buttons, cards, etc.)
   - Create a more comprehensive shared component library

4. **Move Toward a Shared Package:**
   - Once the approach is proven, consider moving these shared components to an NPM package
   - This will make updates easier and ensure consistency across all applications

5. **Document the Shared Components:**
   - Create documentation for the shared components
   - Include guidelines for when and how to use them

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Brand Consistency:** Users will recognize they're using CodeQual products
2. **Reduced Duplication:** Code is more maintainable with less duplication
3. **Faster Development:** New features can be added to both applications more quickly
4. **Improved User Experience:** Consistent UX across the product suite
5. **Flexible Implementation:** Each application maintains its unique functionality

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a unified suite of products under the CodeQual brand while preserving each application's distinct purpose and identity.
