# Dependencies Update Guide

## Critical React Router Update

The authentication issues we've encountered were related to React Router context. Please update the following dependencies to ensure compatibility:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom@latest
```

## Current Package Dependencies

This is the recommended versions list for the key dependencies in this project:

| Package              | Recommended Version | Description                            |
|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| react                | ^18.2.0             | Core React library                     |
| react-dom            | ^18.2.0             | React DOM rendering                    |
| react-router-dom     | ^6.21.0             | React Router for navigation            |
| @supabase/supabase-js| ^2.39.0             | Supabase client for authentication     |
| typescript           | ^5.3.3              | TypeScript language                    |

## Updating Process

1. Update your package.json file with the recommended versions
2. Run `npm install` to update the dependencies
3. Test the authentication flow to ensure it works correctly
4. Pay special attention to React Router integration

## Potential Breaking Changes

When updating React Router, be aware of these potential breaking changes:

1. The `<Switch>` component has been replaced with `<Routes>`
2. Route definitions now use the element prop instead of component/render
3. useHistory has been replaced with useNavigate
4. Nested routes now work differently 

## Testing After Update

After updating dependencies, run the following tests:

1. Test the login flow
2. Test the forgot password flow
3. Test navigation between authentication pages
4. Test protected routes access
5. Test the error handling components

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist after updating, here's a rollback plan:

1. Revert package.json to the previous version
2. Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
3. Run `npm install` 
4. Restart the development server

## Additional Notes

The React Router compatibility issue we've encountered is a common issue when using hooks like `useNavigate` outside of a Router context. Our fixes should handle this gracefully now, but keeping dependencies up to date will help prevent similar issues in the future.
