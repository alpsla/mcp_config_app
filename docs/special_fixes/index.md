## Authentication and Router Context Fix

**Issue Date**: March 2025

**Problem**: The application was experiencing errors with React Router context in authentication components:

```
ERROR: useNavigate() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component.
```

**Files**:
- [Router Authentication Fix Documentation](./Router_Authentication_Fix.md) - Detailed explanation of the fixes
- [Dependencies Update Guide](./Dependencies_Update_Guide.md) - Guide to update dependencies after the fix
- [auth-test.js](./auth-test.js) - Browser console script to test authentication flow

## Key Changes

1. Added proper Router context wrapping in the application
2. Created a safe navigation hook (`useSafeNavigation`) that handles Router context errors
3. Enhanced error handling and error recovery
4. Implemented an ErrorBoundary component to catch and handle React errors

## Implementation Details

The fix addresses several key areas:

### Router Context Integration

- Added proper `<BrowserRouter>` wrapping in index.tsx
- Updated App.tsx to use Routes and Route components
- Fixed navigation between authentication components

### Safe Navigation

Created a custom `useSafeNavigation` hook that:
- Complies with React Hooks rules
- Provides fallbacks when navigation fails
- Handles errors gracefully

### Error Handling

- Enhanced AuthErrorHandler to better diagnose errors
- Added visual notifications for authentication errors
- Implemented automatic recovery mechanisms

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Run the application
2. Navigate between authentication pages
3. Test the forgot password and reset password flows
4. Use the auth-test.js script in the browser console for additional testing

## Dependencies Update

After applying the fix, update dependencies with:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom@latest
```

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider adding more comprehensive testing for authentication flows
2. Implement logging for authentication errors
3. Regularly update dependencies to prevent similar compatibility issues
