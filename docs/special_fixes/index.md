## Implementation Status

All of these fixes have been implemented in the codebase. The documentation is provided for reference and to help understand the changes that were made.

## Testing Guidelines

After implementing these fixes, a complete test of the authentication flow should include:

1. User registration with email, first name, and last name
2. Email verification (checking that the button is visible)
3. Logging in after verification
4. Checking the database to ensure profile data is properly saved

## Future Considerations

1. **Unit and Integration Tests**: Consider adding tests for the authentication flow to prevent regressions
2. **Monitoring**: Add more comprehensive logging for authentication issues
3. **Error Handling**: Consider enhancing the error handling for edge cases
4. **Documentation**: Keep this documentation updated as the application evolves
