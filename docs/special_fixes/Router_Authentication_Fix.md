# Router Authentication Fix

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing an error when trying to navigate between authentication screens:

```
ERROR
useNavigate() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component. at invariant
```

This error occurred in the ForgotPassword component. The root cause was that the component was trying to use the `useNavigate` hook from React Router, but the component was not properly wrapped in a Router context.

## Implemented Fixes

We've implemented several fixes to address this issue:

1. **Router Context Integration**:
   - Added proper `<BrowserRouter>` wrapping in the root index.tsx file
   - Updated App.tsx to use proper Routes and Route components
   - Fixed navigation across authentication components

2. **Safe Navigation Hook**:
   - Created a custom `useSafeNavigation` hook that follows React Hook rules
   - Provides fallbacks when Router context is missing
   - Handles navigation errors gracefully

3. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed error diagnostics
   - Implemented visual notifications for errors
   - Created automatic recovery mechanisms

4. **Error Boundary Component**:
   - Added a global ErrorBoundary to catch React errors
   - Implemented specific handling for router context errors

## Key Files Modified

1. `/src/index.tsx` - Added Router wrapping
2. `/src/App.tsx` - Implemented Routes and ErrorBoundary
3. `/src/utils/navigation/useSafeNavigation.ts` - Created safe navigation hook
4. `/src/utils/authErrorHandler.ts` - Enhanced error handling
5. `/src/utils/errorConfig.ts` - Added centralized error configuration
6. `/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Added error boundary component
7. `/src/pages/forgot-password/index.tsx` - Updated to use safe navigation
8. `/src/auth/ResetPassword.tsx` - Updated to use safe navigation

## How to Use the New Hooks

Always use the `useSafeNavigation` hook instead of React Router's `useNavigate`:

```tsx
// Before (causes errors if Router context is missing)
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
const Component = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  // ...
  return <button onClick={() => navigate('/login')}>Login</button>;
};

// After (safe with fallbacks)
import { useSafeNavigation } from '../../utils/navigation/useSafeNavigation';
const Component = () => {
  const { navigateSafely } = useSafeNavigation();
  // ...
  return <button onClick={() => navigateSafely('/login')}>Login</button>;
};
```

## Testing the Authentication Flow

To verify that the fixes work correctly:

1. Test navigation between all authentication pages:
   - Login
   - Forgot Password
   - Reset Password
   - Verify Email

2. Test error recovery by simulating issues:
   - Use the included auth-test.js script in browser console
   - Watch for proper error notifications
   - Confirm automatic recovery

## Notes on React Hooks Rules

The React Hooks rules require hooks to be called unconditionally at the top level. Our implementation of `useSafeNavigation` ensures this by:

1. Always calling `useNavigate()` at the top level
2. Catching any errors that occur during the hook call
3. Providing safe fallbacks when navigation is not available

This approach follows best practices while still providing robust error handling.

## Dependencies Update

We recommend updating React Router to the latest version:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom@latest
```

This update should help prevent similar issues in the future by ensuring compatibility with the latest React features.

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider adding more comprehensive testing for authentication flows
2. Implement logging for authentication errors to track issues
3. Regularly update dependencies to prevent similar compatibility issues
