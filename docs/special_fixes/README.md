## Authentication System Fixes

### Current Authentication Structure

The authentication system consists of these key components:

- `AuthContext.tsx` - Provides the authentication context and hooks
- `AuthProvider.tsx` - Provides the authentication state management
- `AuthContainer.tsx` - Main authentication UI component with both login and registration forms

### How Authentication Works

1. `AuthProvider` is injected at the root level of the application in `App.tsx`
2. `AuthContainer` is shown to unauthenticated users
3. The `useAuth` hook from `AuthContext` is used throughout the application to access authentication state and functions

### Form Field Ordering Fix

The registration form in `AuthContainer.tsx` has been modified to place form fields in this order:
1. Email
2. First Name (signup mode only)
3. Last Name (signup mode only)
4. Password
5. Confirm Password (signup mode only)

## Email Verification Fixes

### Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Button Text in Verification Emails**
   - The verification email button's text was not visible in some email clients
   - Fixed by replacing fancy button with simpler, more compatible HTML
   - Added multiple fallbacks including plain text links

2. **Verification Process Improvements**
   - Enhanced the `VerifyEmail.tsx` component to handle different verification URL formats
   - Added debugging information to diagnose issues
   - Improved error messages for better user experience
   - Added delay to ensure profile creation completes before redirecting

### Verification Flow

The email verification process is handled in the `VerifyEmail.tsx` component. After a user signs up:
1. They receive an email with a verification link
2. Clicking the link takes them to the verification page
3. Upon successful verification, a profile is created if needed
4. The user is then redirected to the login page with a success parameter

## Profile Data Issues

### Fixed Issues

1. **Missing Profile Data**
   - Email, first_name, and last_name fields were not being saved to profiles table
   - Fixed by enhancing the profile creation process
   - Added error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. **Profile Creation Logic**
   - Added robust `createUserProfile` helper function
   - Enhanced debugging of profile creation issues
   - Implemented error handling for table structure issues

## Code Organization

### Unused Components Cleanup

Some previously created authentication components were redundant and have been moved to an `unused` directory:
- `LoginForm.tsx` - A standalone login form component
- `RegisterForm.tsx` - A standalone registration form component
- `RegistrationForm.tsx` - Another standalone registration form component

These components were removed because the application uses the `AuthContainer.tsx` component directly, which contains its own integrated login and registration functionality.

## Database Schema Updates

### Profile Table Schema Fixes

SQL scripts have been created in the `db-updates` directory to ensure the profiles table has the correct structure:

1. **Create Profiles Table Script**
   - Creates the profiles table if it doesn't exist
   - Sets up proper foreign key relationship with auth.users
   - Adds appropriate indices for performance
   - Implements Row Level Security policies

2. **Add/Update Columns Script**
   - Adds email, first_name, and last_name columns if they don't exist
   - Updates existing profiles with email data from auth.users
   - Tests column existence to prevent errors

### Applying Database Updates

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Run the scripts in this order:
   a. First run `create_profiles_table.sql` to ensure the profiles table exists
   b. Then run `add_profile_columns.sql` to add or update needed columns

### Manual SQL Query

If you prefer, you can also run this basic query to add the email column directly:

```sql
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS first_name VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_name VARCHAR(100);

-- Update existing profiles with email data from auth.users
UPDATE profiles p
SET email = a.email
FROM auth.users a
WHERE p.id = a.id 
AND (p.email IS NULL OR p.email = '');
```
