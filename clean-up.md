# Dashboard Cleanup

The following actions were taken to clean up the dashboard implementation:

1. Fixed string quotes in testimonials to properly handle apostrophes
2. Removed unused variables (useEffect and setConfigurations)
3. Created a clean placeholder for NewDashboard.jsx to resolve linting errors
4. Moved all archived files to a separate archive directory outside src
5. Renamed component class names from "new-dashboard" to just "dashboard"

## Next Steps

1. The application should be able to compile successfully now
2. The dashboard should display correctly with all its components:
   - Welcome banner
   - Services section
   - Pricing plans
   - Premium models
   - Example showcase
   - Testimonials
   - Coming soon section

## Future Improvements

1. Add real functionality to the configuration creation button
2. Implement the video example when ready
3. Connect to backend services for dynamic data

## Files to Delete Later

Once the application is stable, you may consider deleting:
- `/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/mcp-config-app/src/components/dashboard/NewDashboard.jsx`
- `/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/mcp-config-app/archive/dashboard-old`
