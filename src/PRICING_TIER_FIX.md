# Pricing Tier Selection Issue Fix

## Problem Description
Users selecting the Basic plan ($4.99) would see the Complete plan ($8.99) on the payment information page instead of their selected plan.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the code, several issues were found in the subscription flow:

1. **Tier Parameter Passing**: When navigating from the pricing page to the subscription flow, the plan parameter was correctly included in the URL, but wasn't being properly passed through to the components.

2. **Context Initialization**: The SubscriptionFlowContext was using a default tier of 'basic' but incorrectly resolving the tier details in some cases.

3. **Tier Resolution**: The `safeGetTierById` function didn't handle the 'basic' tier properly in the fallback case, defaulting to the hard-coded basic tier details instead of using the pricing configuration.

4. **Parameter Validation**: The RouteHandler component wasn't consistently passing the plan parameter to the subscription flow components.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Logging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the subscription flow to track tier selection and resolution.

2. **Fixed Tier Resolution**: Updated the `getDefaultTierDetails` function to explicitly handle 'basic', 'complete', and 'none' tiers with the correct pricing.

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error handling in the `safeGetTierById` function to ensure consistent behavior.

4. **Added Debug Logs**: Added debug logs when handling subscriptions in Dashboard and PricingPage components.

5. **Improved Navigation**: Enhanced the plan parameter handling when navigating to the subscription flow.

## How to Test the Fix

1. Navigate to the Dashboard or Pricing Page
2. Click on the "Upgrade" button for the Basic plan ($4.99)
3. Confirm the subscription terms in the modal
4. Proceed to the payment step
5. Verify that the payment step shows the correct plan and price ($4.99 for Basic plan)

## Technical Notes

The key issue was in the tier resolution logic in `SubscriptionFlowContext.tsx`. If the actual pricing configuration couldn't be loaded, the fallback logic would always return the 'basic' tier details regardless of the requested tier ID. This was fixed by updating the fallback logic to correctly handle all tier types.

The subscription flow now properly retains the selected tier throughout the entire process, ensuring users see the correct plan details and pricing.
