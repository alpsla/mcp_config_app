# Payment Tier Display Fix with URL-Based Override

## Problem Description
Users selecting the Basic plan ($4.99) continued to see the Complete plan ($8.99) on the payment information page despite our previous fixes.

## Solution: URL-Based Tier Override

We've implemented a direct URL-based override approach to ensure the correct plan and pricing is displayed regardless of any potential issues with state management or context:

1. **Added URL Parameter Detection:**
   - The PaymentStep component now directly checks the URL hash for `plan=basic` or `plan=complete`
   - This provides a reliable way to determine which plan was selected, regardless of context state issues

2. **Implemented Forced Tier Logic:**
   ```typescript
   const forcedTier = window.location.hash.includes('plan=basic') ? 'basic' : 
                      window.location.hash.includes('plan=complete') ? 'complete' : 
                      selectedTier;
   ```

3. **Applied Force Tier to All UI Elements:**
   - Used the `forcedTier` value instead of `selectedTier` for all display elements
   - Ensured consistent pricing display throughout the payment page

4. **Added Comprehensive Debugging:**
   - Included detailed console logging for tier selection and URL parameters
   - Added a global debug variable `window.DEBUG_PAYMENT_STEP` for real-time debugging in the browser console
   - Implemented tracking for tier changes via refs

## How to Verify the Fix

1. **Navigate to the Dashboard or Pricing Page**
2. **Select the Basic Plan ($4.99)**
3. **Proceed through the subscription flow**
4. **When reaching the Payment Page:**
   - Check the console logs for debugging information
   - Verify that "Basic Plan (Monthly)" and "$4.99" is displayed in the Order Summary
   - Confirm the URL contains `plan=basic` parameter

## Technical Details

This solution bypasses potential issues in state management by directly reading the plan parameter from the URL. This approach provides a reliable backup mechanism that ensures the correct plan is always displayed regardless of any complex state management issues that might occur during the subscription flow.

We've also added extensive debugging to help troubleshoot any similar issues in the future.

## Future Considerations

While this direct URL parameter approach solves the immediate issue, it would be beneficial to address the root cause of the state management problems in the subscription flow. Consider:

1. Refactoring the subscription flow to use a more robust state management approach
2. Adding more explicit logging throughout the subscription flow
3. Implementing proper unit and integration tests for the subscription process

This fix ensures users will always see the correct plan pricing information regardless of underlying issues in the state management system.
