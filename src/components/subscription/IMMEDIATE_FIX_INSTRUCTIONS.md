# Immediate Fix Instructions

These instructions will help you apply an immediate fix to the Parameters page in the subscription flow without waiting for a full deployment.

## Option 1: Apply the fix using Developer Console

1. Open your application in a browser and navigate to the Parameters page in the subscription flow
2. Open the browser's Developer Console (F12 or Right-click > Inspect > Console)
3. Copy and paste the entire content of the `apply-fixes.js` file into the console
4. Press Enter to run the script
5. The fixes should be applied immediately to the current page

## Option 2: Add the fixes to your HTML

For a more permanent fix until the proper implementation is deployed, you can add this script to your application's HTML:

1. Open your main HTML file (typically `index.html` or similar)
2. Add the following script tag before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script>
// Copy the entire content of apply-fixes.js here
</script>
```

3. Save the file and restart your application

## Proper Implementation

While the above options provide immediate fixes, you should still implement the proper React component changes:

1. Replace the `PresetSaver.tsx` component with the fixed version (`PresetSaver.fixed.tsx`)
2. Update the `ParameterSlider.tsx` with better accessibility features
3. Fix the Hugging Face token header styling

## What This Fix Addresses

- **Save Button Position**: Ensures the preset save button appears properly positioned in the form layout (not as a popup)
- **Accessibility**: Improves accessibility for all form elements
- **Styling**: Fixes the Hugging Face API Token header styling

## Troubleshooting

If the fixes don't appear to work:

1. Check the browser console for any error messages
2. Make sure you're applying the fix on the correct page
3. Try refreshing the page and applying the fix again
4. If styled components or CSS modules are being used, you may need to modify the selectors in the fix script to match your actual DOM structure

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues, please check the browser's element inspector to identify the actual structure of your DOM elements, and modify the selectors in the fix script accordingly.
