# Subscription Flow Component Architecture

## Overview

This directory contains the components for the subscription flow in the MCP Configuration App. The architecture has been refactored to follow React best practices and avoid direct DOM manipulation.

## Key Components

### SubscriptionFlow.tsx
The main container component that manages the state of the subscription flow and renders the appropriate step based on the current state.

### ProgressBar.tsx
A dedicated React component for rendering the step progress indicator. This component takes the current step and an array of step names as props and renders the progress bar accordingly. No DOM manipulation is used - all styling is handled through CSS classes applied based on React state.

### Step Components
- **WelcomeStep**: Introduces the subscription flow
- **ProfileStep**: Collects user profile information
- **InterestsStep**: Gathers user interests and use cases
- **ParametersStep**: Configures technical parameters
- **PaymentStep**: Handles payment information
- **SuccessStep**: Confirms successful subscription

## CSS Structure

- **SubscriptionFlow.css**: Styles for the container and common elements
- **ProgressBar.css**: Dedicated styles for the progress bar
- **[StepName].css**: Individual stylesheets for each step

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Each piece of UI is a self-contained React component
2. **Prop-Driven Styling**: Visual states are controlled via props passed to components
3. **Separation of Concerns**: CSS is organized to match component structure
4. **Clean Rendering Logic**: No direct DOM manipulation (querySelector, appendChild, etc.)
5. **Consistent State Management**: Form state is handled using standard React patterns

## Implementation Notes

The progress bar has been completely refactored to be a proper React component. This eliminates the need for DOM manipulation scripts that were causing conflicts and unpredictable behavior.

Each step now focuses solely on its own content and functionality, leaving navigation and progress tracking to the parent components.

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur with the step display or progress bar:

1. Check React component props and state flow
2. Verify CSS classes are being applied correctly
3. Ensure no legacy DOM manipulation scripts are being loaded
4. Monitor the console for React lifecycle logging
