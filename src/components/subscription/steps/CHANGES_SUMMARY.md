# MCP Project Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed
1. Interest boxes not visible when switching to the Interests page
2. Infinite loop of logging "Interests page detected, applying specific fix"
3. Direct DOM manipulation scripts causing conflicts and maintenance issues

## Changes Made

### 1. Created a Clean useUIFixes Hook
Created a non-intrusive hook that doesn't manipulate the DOM directly but helps with debugging and tracking component lifecycles.

Location: `/src/hooks/useUIFixes.ts`

### 2. Fixed InterestsStepEnhanced Component
- Removed inline styles that could conflict with CSS classes
- Created a dedicated CSS file for the component
- Proper React class names instead of inline styles
- Simplified component structure for better maintainability
- Removed dynamic DOM manipulation via injected scripts

### 3. Improved ParametersStep Component
- Added proper CSS instead of relying on DOM manipulation
- Fixed slider styling through CSS rather than JavaScript
- Fixed form controls accessibility through CSS
- Removed dependency on the problematic accessibilityFix.js script

### 4. Removed Problematic Scripts
- Backed up and removed accessibilityFix.js which was causing conflicts
- Eliminated all direct DOM manipulation scripts
- Focused on using React's component-based approach

## Implementation Details
- CSS selectors now use proper specificity to avoid conflicts
- Used proper React lifecycle methods (useEffect) for component management
- Added debugging logs to track component rendering
- Ensured consistent styling across components
- Maintained the original design and functionality while improving the implementation

## Testing Plan
1. Navigate through the subscription flow to verify all steps render correctly
2. Check that interest boxes appear properly on the Interests page
3. Verify that there are no infinite loops in the console logs
4. Test interactions with all form components to ensure they work as expected
5. Verify that styles are consistent across all steps
6. Check accessibility of all form controls
7. Test on different screen sizes to ensure responsive design works correctly

## Future Recommendations
1. Continue using React's component-based approach and avoid direct DOM manipulation
2. Consider implementing a design system for consistent styling across components
3. Add unit tests for components to catch regressions early
4. Implement proper error boundaries for better error handling
5. Consider using styled-components or CSS modules to avoid style conflicts
