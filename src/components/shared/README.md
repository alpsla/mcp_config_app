# Shared Components

This directory contains shared UI components used across the application.

## Badge Component

The Badge component has been modified to hide:
- "Desktop Only" badges
- "Premium" badges

This change was made to improve the user interface and prevent confusion,
as all services are currently desktop-only and subscription status is now
displayed in a more intuitive manner.

## Changelog

- March 2025: Modified Badge.jsx to hide Desktop Only and Premium badges
