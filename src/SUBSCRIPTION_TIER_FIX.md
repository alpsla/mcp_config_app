# Subscription Tier Selection Fix

## Problem Description
Users selecting the Basic plan ($4.99) were seeing the Complete plan ($8.99) on the payment information page. The plan selection wasn't being properly maintained throughout the subscription flow.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the code, several issues were identified:

1. **Inconsistent Parameter Naming**: In RouteHandler.jsx, the component was looking for a "tier" parameter while the URLs were using "plan" parameter.

2. **Hardcoded Values**: The WelcomeStep component had hardcoded pricing values instead of using dynamic values from the tier selection.

3. **Context State Management**: The subscription flow wasn't properly updating the selected tier when navigating between steps.

4. **Order Summary Display**: The PaymentStep component was using potentially incorrect tier information from the pricing configuration instead of ensuring the correct tier was displayed.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed URL Parameter Handling**:
   - Updated RouteHandler.jsx to look for the "plan" parameter instead of "tier"
   - Added additional debug logging to track parameter passing

2. **Fixed Hardcoded Values**:
   - Updated WelcomeStep to use the dynamic price value from the tier details
   - Removed hardcoded price references

3. **Improved Tier State Management**:
   - Added useEffect in SubscriptionFlowContent to ensure the initialTier is used when navigating between steps
   - Added setSelectedTier to maintain tier selection throughout the flow

4. **Fixed Order Summary Display**:
   - Updated the Order Summary section to explicitly check the selectedTier value
   - Used direct price values ($4.99 for Basic, $8.99 for Complete) instead of relying on potentially incorrect tier details

5. **Added Comprehensive Logging**:
   - Added detailed logging throughout the subscription flow to help debug and maintain the code

## Testing
To test this fix:
1. Navigate to the Dashboard or Pricing page
2. Click on the "Upgrade" button for the Basic plan ($4.99)
3. Verify that the welcome page shows $4.99
4. Proceed through the subscription flow
5. Verify that the Payment Information page shows "Basic Plan (Monthly)" and "$4.99"

## Technical Notes
The primary issue was the inconsistent parameter naming between different parts of the application. By standardizing on the "plan" parameter and ensuring the selected tier is properly maintained throughout the subscription flow, users will now see the correct plan and pricing information at every step.

Going forward, any changes to the subscription flow should be carefully tested to ensure the selected tier is maintained throughout the entire process.
