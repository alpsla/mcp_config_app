## Implementation Details

### Authentication System Architecture

The refactored authentication system follows this structure:

```
src/services/auth/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ authClient.ts     (Supabase client initialization)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ authService.ts    (Core authentication functions)
â”œâ”€â”€ email/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ emailAuthService.ts  (Email auth functions)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ emailTemplates.ts    (Email templates)
â”œâ”€â”€ oauth/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ oauthService.ts      (OAuth auth functions)
â”œâ”€â”€ profile/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ profileService.ts    (Profile management)
â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ authTypes.ts         (Shared types and interfaces)
â””â”€â”€ index.ts                 (Re-exports everything)
```

Key features of the new authentication system:

1. **Multi-Strategy Profile Creation**
   - Direct insert attempt first
   - Fallback to upsert approach
   - Final fallback to RPC function that bypasses RLS

2. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error logging
   - Graceful fallbacks at each step
   - Clear user feedback

3. **Better Code Organization**
   - Specific modules for different authentication aspects
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Improved testability and maintainability

### Hugging Face Tier Selection UI

The tiered model selection UI will:

1. **Show All Models for All Users**
   - Display all 10 models to every user
   - Clearly indicate which models are available based on tier

2. **Implement Tier-Specific Behaviors**
   - Non-subscribers: "Subscribe to Enable" button
   - Basic Tier: Select up to 3 models from entire pool
   - Complete Tier: Access all 10 models

3. **Provide Clear Upgrade Paths**
   - Show inline upgrade prompts when tier limits are reached
   - Provide tier comparison information
   - Implement smooth upgrade flow

### Configuration Validation Flow

The configuration validation system will:

1. **Validate Configurations Locally**
   - Check for required fields
   - Verify token formats
   - Validate path formats

2. **Perform Server-Side Validation**
   - Test API token validity
   - Check directory access permissions
   - Validate against Claude's requirements

3. **Provide Clear Feedback**
   - Show validation status for each service
   - Provide actionable error messages
   - Offer guided remediation steps

This implementation plan will be reviewed and updated bi-weekly to reflect current progress and any shifting priorities.
