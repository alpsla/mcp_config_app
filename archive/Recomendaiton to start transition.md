MCP Configuration Tool - Code Transition Recommendations
Current Structure Assessment
After reviewing the existing codebase, I've identified the following key components that can be leveraged for our new implementation:

Data Model Foundation

The types.ts file provides a solid base for our data structures
MCPServer, MCPConfiguration interfaces are well-designed
MCPServerConfig already handles the core needs


Service Architecture

The separation of concerns between services is appropriate
ConfigurationService and MCPServerService follow good patterns
Desktop config generation is already implemented


Wizard Flow

The 4-step configuration process is conceptually aligned with our plan
Progress indicators and navigation are in place



Recommended Code Transitions
Phase 1: Immediate Refactoring (1-2 weeks)

Two-Panel Layout

Convert ConfigurationWizard.tsx to use two-panel design
Keep the step logic but modify the visual layout
Implement simpler, direct help system instead of tooltips


Quick-Start Templates

Add template configurations to ConfigurationService
Create template selection UI in the wizard
Preserve the existing configuration mechanisms


Empty State

Add "waiting state" illustration when no server is selected
Keep current server selection functionality but enhance UI



Phase 2: Auth Integration (2-3 weeks)

Supabase Integration

Create new auth directory structure
Implement login/registration components
Connect user accounts to configurations


Tier Management

Add subscription types to the data model
Implement access control for Hugging Face models
Create tiered model selection components


Dashboard Redesign

Replace tab-based navigation with new dashboard layout
Implement benefits visualization
Add pricing tier comparison

Transition Approach
If development time becomes limited, prioritize the following incremental steps:

Minimal Viable Product

Implement two-panel layout first
Add basic Supabase authentication
Create simplified tier structure
Keep existing configuration logic


Progressive Enhancement

Add features in order of user impact
Prioritize onboarding before marketplace
Implement token validation before full API integration


Feature Toggles

Use feature flags to hide incomplete features
Create placeholder UI for upcoming features
Clearly mark "Coming Soon" items



Documentation Priority

Create documentation files for:

Hugging Face token setup
Web search configuration
File system permissions


Implement these before full marketplace features to ensure users can at least configure the basics effectively.
