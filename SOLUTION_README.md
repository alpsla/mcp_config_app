# Hugging Face Token Duplication Solution

This document explains how to fix the duplicated message in the Hugging Face token section of the Parametrization page.

## The Problem

The Parametrization page currently displays the same message about secure token storage in two places:

1. In the blue header text: "This token will be stored securely as an environment variable on your device only."
2. In the green box with lock icon: "Your token will be stored securely as an environment variable on your local device only."

## Solution Approach

To fix this, we should keep only one instance of this message. Since the green box with the lock icon provides a more visually distinct security indication, we'll keep that one and remove the duplicate text from the blue header.

## Implementation

1. Find the component that renders the Hugging Face API token section. Based on our analysis, it could be one of these components:
   - HuggingFaceTokenEntry.tsx (newer component we found)
   - TokenInput.tsx (older component)
   - Another component that might not be in the version of the codebase we examined

2. In the identified component, remove the duplicated message from the intro text and only keep it in the security note section.

3. Ensure the component has proper styling to maintain the visual appearance while removing the duplication.

## Example Implementation

The HuggingFaceAPITokenSection.tsx file demonstrates how this would look:

```jsx
// Intro text - only describe what the token is for, not how it's stored
<p className="token-description">
  To access premium models, you'll need a Hugging Face API token.
</p>

// Security note is included only once, not duplicated
<div className="security-note">
  <span className="lock-icon">ðŸ”’</span>
  <p>
    Your token will be stored securely as an environment variable on your local device only.
  </p>
</div>
```

## Next Steps

1. Identify the exact component that's being used in the production version of the Parametrization page
2. Apply this fix to remove the duplicated text
3. Test the change to ensure it maintains the functionality and visual appearance

Remember to keep all the important information about token security, just avoid duplicating the same message in multiple places on the page.
