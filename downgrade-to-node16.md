# Downgrading to Node.js v16

React projects built with older versions of create-react-app work best with Node.js v16. You're currently using Node.js v20.18.1, which might cause compatibility issues. Here's how to downgrade to Node.js v16:

## Using Homebrew (macOS)

If you installed Node.js using Homebrew:

```bash
# Install Node.js 16
brew install node@16

# Unlink current version
brew unlink node

# Link version 16
brew link node@16

# Verify installation
node -v  # Should show v16.x.x
```

## Using the Node.js Installer

1. Visit [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Download the Node.js 16.x.x LTS installer for your operating system
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions

## Alternative: Using nvm (Node Version Manager)

nvm allows you to easily switch between Node.js versions:

```bash
# Install nvm if you don't have it
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash

# Install Node.js 16
nvm install 16

# Use Node.js 16
nvm use 16

# Verify installation
node -v  # Should show v16.x.x
```

After downgrading to Node.js v16, try running `pnpm install` and `pnpm start` again.
